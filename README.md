# Sales Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with R

Forecasted over 3,500 time series for various products across multiple stores, applying advanced forecasting models such as *ARIMA* and *STL+ETS*. Model's prediction error translates in average to ~$15 per week in potential revenue miscalculation. Forecasted data was integrated into an interactive dashboard, enabling real-time visualization and data-driven decision-making for enhanced inventory and sales strategy.

## Overview
- **Data Preparation**: Includes cleaning, transforming, and structuring the raw sales dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into the data, addressing promotional effects, outliers and features summary.
- **Model Validation**: Uses a sub-dataset to validate and select within the following models:
    - **ARIMA** and their variations: default, with lagged predictors, with seasonal predictors and both.
    - Seasonal descomposition with exponential smoothing applied to errors (**STL + ETS**).
    - Default neural network (**NNETAR**) with regressors.
    - Default **Prophet** model with regressors.

- **Model Fitting and Forecasting**: Applies the chosen models to the entire dataset to generate forecasts.
- **Results Storage**: Saves all predictions in a comprehensive and lightweight Parquet format for easy access and analysis.

## Shiny App Features
- **Interactive Interface**: Allows end users to search for specific stores and products.
- **Predictions Display**: Provides well-curated sales predictions for the selected store and product.
- **Residual Analysis**: Offers insights into the model performance through residual analysis.
- **Feature Correlation**: Displays correlations between features and sales, aiding in understanding the factors influencing sales.
